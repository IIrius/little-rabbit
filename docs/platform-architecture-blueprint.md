## 1. Executive Summary
The platform enables secure, multi-tenant processing of structured and semi-structured data with downstream task orchestration and human-in-the-loop collaboration via Telegram and web channels. The architecture is service-oriented, emphasizing isolation, auditable workflows, and extensibility. This blueprint documents module responsibilities, integration boundaries, data flows, operational guardrails, and deployment topology to guide implementation and growth.

## 2. Guiding Requirements
### 2.1 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** Horizontally scale compute-intensive parsing and processing workloads via container orchestration and asynchronous job queues. Employ auto-scaling policies with workload-aware metrics.
- **Security:** Zero-trust posture inside the cluster; mutual TLS between services; encrypted data at rest (KMS-managed keys) and in transit; secrets managed via vault solution. Continuous vulnerability scanning and dependency management.
- **Anonymity & Privacy:** Pseudonymize tenant and end-user identifiers; segregate data per tenant in logical schemas; minimize PII exposure by default; ensure logs redact sensitive payloads.
- **Reliability:** Target 99.9% availability for core APIs; design idempotent task processing; use circuit breakers and retry policies to protect upstream systems.
- **Observability:** Centralized logging, metrics, and tracing with tenant-aware tagging; define SLOs dashboards; alert on error budget burn.
- **Compliance & Auditability:** Immutable audit log of task state changes; RBAC-enforced administrative actions; configurable retention policies per tenant.

### 2.2 Domain Principles
- **Modularity:** Clear service boundaries allow independent evolution of parsing, orchestration, and delivery channels.
- **Automation with Human Oversight:** Automated pipelines default to machine execution but surface exceptions for manual review via the frontend.
- **API-First:** Every capability exposed through versioned APIs supporting integration with partner systems.
- **Tenant Sovereignty:** Tenants control visibility and lifecycle of their data artifacts and automations.

## 3. Platform Modules

### 3.1 Parsing Service
- **Purpose:** Ingest raw documents (text, PDFs, structured feeds) and produce normalized, tenant-scoped datasets.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Connector framework for file systems, S3-compatible storage, REST feeds.
  - Pluggable parsers using NLP/regex-based extractors; supports tenant-specific parser bundles.
  - Emits parsed records to the Processing Pipeline via message bus.
- **Interfaces:**
  - REST `POST /parse` and batch upload endpoints.
  - gRPC stream for high-throughput ingestion.
  - Consumes storage service APIs for artifact retrieval.
- **Storage:** Object storage (versioned) for raw files; Postgres schema or document DB for parsed fragments.
- **Scaling:** Stateless workers autoscaled by queue depth; CPU-intensive pods scheduled on dedicated node pool.

## 6. Sequence Diagrams

    User-->>Telegram: Response command / acknowledgement
    Telegram-->>TelegramSvc: Webhook callback
    TelegramSvc->>Orchestrator: Update task state with response
    Orchestrator->>Orchestrator: Log audit entry
```

## 7. Tenancy Isolation Strategy
- **Logical Isolation:** Dedicated schemas per tenant in Postgres and namespace per tenant in object storage. Processing topics prefixed with tenant IDs.
- **Runtime Isolation:** Kubernetes namespaces per tenant tier; resource quotas and network policies prevent lateral movement. Sensitive tenants can opt for dedicated node pools.
- **Configuration Isolation:** Tenant configuration stored in encrypted config service with per-tenant keys; service accounts scoped to tenant-specific resources.
- **Cross-Tenant Data Guarantees:** Validation gates ensure outbound notifications or analytics queries cannot join data across tenants without explicit cross-tenant contracts.
- **Anonymity Enhancements:** Use tokenized identifiers throughout pipelines; decrypt only at presentation layer when tenant security policy allows.

## 8. RBAC Model
| Role | Scope | Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Platform Super Admin** | Global | Manage tenants, view system health, rotate keys, configure global policies. Limited to trusted operators. |
| **Tenant Admin** | Tenant | Manage tenant members, assign roles, configure parsers, integration endpoints, SLA policies. |
| **Analyst/Operator** | Tenant | View tasks, approve/reject processing outcomes, trigger manual reprocessing, export reports (respecting audit trails). |
| **Automation Bot** | Tenant | Invoke APIs for automated actions (e.g., update task state) under scoped service tokens; cannot access UI-only endpoints. |
| **Read-Only Auditor** | Tenant/Regulator | Access immutable audit logs and metadata; no write permissions. |

- RBAC enforcement centralized via Authorization service, exposing PDP (policy decision) APIs; services integrate via sidecar or middleware.
- Policies expressed in OPA/Rego or Cedar; evaluated with tenant context and feature flags.

## 9. External Integrations
- **Telegram Bot API:** Primary outbound/inbound messaging channel; use dedicated bots per tenant when isolation required.
- **Object Storage (S3-compatible):** Intake channel for large artifacts; supports customer-managed buckets via signed URLs.
- **Feature Stores / ML Services:** Optional enrichment sources (e.g., Vertex AI, custom ML microservices).
- **Identity Provider (OIDC/SAML):** Integrates with customer IdPs for SSO; MFA enforced via IdP.
- **Analytics & BI:** Read replicas / warehouse exports to Snowflake/BigQuery for tenant dashboards, gated by data sharing agreements.

## 11. Observability & Operations
- **Monitoring Stack:** Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog with dashboards per tenant and subsystem.
- **Logging:** Centralized ELK/OpenSearch with ingestion filters for sensitive data; tenant ID mandatory in log schema.
- **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry instrumentation; traces sampled by tenant-criticality.
- **Alerting:** PagerDuty/On-call rotations; runbooks with SLAs defined per integration.
- **Resilience Testing:** Regular chaos drills on parsing and orchestration subsystems; synthetic transactions to verify Telegram delivery.

## 12. Phase Roadmap

### Phase 0 – Foundation
- Stand up core infrastructure (Kubernetes cluster, CI/CD, secrets management).
- Implement Parsing Service MVP with limited data formats and manual parser configuration.
- Deliver baseline Task Orchestration with manual state transitions.
